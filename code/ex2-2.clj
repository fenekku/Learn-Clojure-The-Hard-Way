; A comment
; Comments can be useful to add more information in your code
; Anything after the ; is ignored when the code is run
(println "I can write comments at the end of a line") ; this comment is ignored
(println "This is useful.")

;You can also comment out code
;(println "This is commented out")

(println "This will run.")
