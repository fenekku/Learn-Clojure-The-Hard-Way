\chapter{Preface}

\quote{I don't know what I am talking about.}

That is probably as honest as anyone will be with you. I am just like you actually. Someone who wants to learn about Lisp. And someone who would rather learn about an offspring that is not too burdened by the past and that can run everywhere. Clojure ticks those conditions off, so it was chosen. Why not?!

I am writing this because I actually don't know Clojure much (or at-all depending on your guru-ness). And since Learn X the Hard Way is the best way to learn anything (TM), I decided to go down this avenue. Teaching something is one of the best ways to learn, so let's do this!

That means there will be plenty of mistakes, incorrect explanations and unconventional code. Thankfully the internet is there. To shame, belittle and humiliate me that is. And maybe provide help amidst the beating. 

Oh. And by the way, I don't know Latex either.
